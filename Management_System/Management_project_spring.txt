Project Name Library Management System

Project Description
This system allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete books in the library. It also allows users to check out and return books, and keeps track of who has a book and whether a book is available or not.

Requirements

com.daVinciCode.Management_System.Book Management Users can add a book to the system with details such as title, author, ISBN, publication year, and number of copies. Users can also update details about a book, delete a book from the system, or retrieve details about a book.

Check Out and Return Users can check out a book if it's available. When a book is checked out, the system should mark it as unavailable. Users can also return a book they have checked out, and the system should mark it as available again.

User Management The system should keep track of which user has checked out which book.

Technologies to be Used

Spring Boot This is the core framework you'll be using to build your application. It simplifies the setup of a Spring application and includes many useful defaults.

Spring Data JPA You'll use this to interact with your database. It provides a way to define and execute database queries using Java methods.

H2 Database This is a simple in-memory database that's useful for development because it doesn't require any setup.

Spring REST This is used to create REST APIs for the front-end to interact with the back-end.

Spring Security This is used for basic authentication and authorization of users.

Maven or Gradle You'll use one of these build tools to manage your project's dependencies.

Steps

Setup Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your favorite IDE. Make sure to include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and H2 Database.

Database Setup Create entities for Books and Users using JPA annotations. For Books, you might have fields for id, title, author, ISBN, publication year, and availability. For Users, you might have fields for id, name, email, and a list of books they've checked out.

Repository Setup Create a repository interface for each entity. Spring Data JPA can automatically implement these interfaces for you.

Service Setup Create a service for each entity. These services should use the repositories to perform database operations.

Controller Setup Create a controller for each entity. These controllers should use the services to perform operations in response to HTTP requests.

Security Setup Configure Spring Security to require authentication for certain requests.

Testing Write unit tests for your services and integration tests for your controllers.

Deployment Finally, run your application and interact with it using a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests.

As you work on this project, you'll get a chance to practice many important concepts like MVC design, CRUD operations, REST APIs, and basic authentication and authorization. You'll also learn about many key features of the Spring ecosystem.
